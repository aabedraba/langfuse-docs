      "A: To trace a Python application with Langfuse, you can use the Python SDK v3, which supports W3C Trace Context IDs for distributed tracing. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initialize the Langfuse client in your application.\n",
      "2. Use the `@observe()` decorator to automatically create and link spans, generations, events, etc.\n",
      "3. Optionally, generate deterministic trace IDs using `create_trace_id()` if needed.\n",
      "4. Use the `start_as_current_span()` method to manually create spans and set trace context.\n",
      "5. Access the current trace ID and propagate it across components or services.\n",
      "6. Ensure to call `langfuse.flush()` or `langfuse.shutdown()` before your application terminates to send all data.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find more detailed instructions and code samples in the [Langfuse documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/trace-ids). If you'd like, I can provide specific code snippets or further guidance.\n",

      "A: Langfuse is an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) engineering platform designed to help teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications. It offers native integrations of various features to accelerate the development workflow. You can find more details in their [official documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs).\n",

      "MCP Tool call: searchLangfuseDocs with args: {'query': 'trace retention'}\n",
      "A: By default, Langfuse will keep all traces forever (i.e. “indefinitely”). If you enable the Data Retention feature on a per-project basis (available on Pro Team Add-On, Enterprise Cloud, or Self-Hosted Enterprise), you can specify a retention period in days (minimum 3 days). Any traces (as well as observations, scores, and media assets) older than that period will be picked up by a nightly cleanup job and permanently deleted.  \n",
