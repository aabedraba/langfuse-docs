# Langfuse is fully open source

> Langfuse is built in the open. We believe open source and sustainable commercialization can coexist—and this strategy is how we fund continuous, community-driven innovation that's adopted across startups and enterprises.

## Why is Langfuse open source?

1. **Transparency & Trust**: Developers can inspect every line that handles their data, audit security practices, and avoid vendor lock-in.
2. **Community Collaboration**: The open source community moves quickly and accelerates [integrations](/docs/integrations/overview) with LangChain, LiteLLM, OpenTelemetry, and the next library you'll build tomorrow. Join our community on [GitHub Discussions](/ideas) to shape the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap).
3. **Faster Innovation**: Shared ownership means bugs are squashed and features land sooner.
4. **Sovereignty**: You can run Langfuse anywhere — from your laptop to an air-gapped cluster — without hitting artificial usage caps. [Self-host](/self-hosting) it on your own infrastructure.
5. **Extensible**: All data is accessible via the public [API](/docs/api) which is fully tested. You can wrap/extend Langfuse or build your own workflows and AI platform around it.

## Architecture Consistency & Scale

The Langfuse deployment stack is exactly the same when using Langfuse Cloud and when self-hosting Langfuse. See our [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting) for instructions on running Langfuse locally and deployments at production scale.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Langfuse really open source?

Yes. Langfuse is 100% open source using the Apache 2.0 license — an OSI-approved license.

### Does Langfuse rely only on open-source components?

Yes. The entire stack is open source and can be self-hosted. Find a complete list in the configuration files across our repositories:

- Langfuse server: monorepo with [multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse%20package.json&type=code)
- Langfuse Python SDK: main [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
- Langfuse JS SDK: monorepo with [multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse-js%20package.json&type=code)

As the core Langfuse server is most actively developed, we run an [automated license check](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/actions/workflows/licensecheck.yml) on every change to avoid adding dependencies with non-permissive licenses. If you find any issues, please let us know.

### What's the release cadence and how do I stay up to date?

We cut a **GitHub Release multiple times a week** (tagged `vX.Y.Z`) and publish detailed notes in the [changelog](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases). Langfuse Cloud is always running the latest version; self-host users can pull the identical Docker image tag to stay up to date or upgrade on their own schedule ([docs](/self-hosting/upgrade)).

### Does the OSS build phone home? Can I disable telemetry?

By default, Langfuse reports **aggregated usage analytics** (no personal data) so we know which features matter. **No traces, prompts, or customer data leave your cluster.** You can opt out of this.

### Can I run Langfuse completely offline / air-gapped?

Yes. After the initial image pull, Langfuse **does not require any outbound network calls** to work. Teams in regulated environments run it inside air-gapped Kubernetes clusters; just disable telemetry as above and mirror the Docker registry locally.

### How do I contribute?

Here are the best ways to contribute to Langfuse via GitHub:

1. Submit and vote on [Ideas](/ideas).
2. Create and comment on [Issues](/issues).
3. Create a pull request. See [Contributing.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
