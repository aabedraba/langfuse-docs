# Data Regions

Langfuse Cloud offers multiple data regions to help you meet data residency and compliance requirements.

## Available Data Regions

Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, partly managed by Clickhouse:

- **US data region**: [https://us.cloud.langfuse.com](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com) - Oregon (AWS us-west-2)
- **EU data region**: [https://cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) - Ireland (AWS eu-west-1)
- **HIPAA-compliant region**: [https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com](https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com) - For HIPAA-eligible accounts

## Data Isolation

Each data region operates independently to ensure data residency compliance:

- Your data stays within the region you select
- No cross-region data transfers occur without explicit configuration
- Each region has its own infrastructure and backups

## Selecting a Data Region

When you sign up for Langfuse Cloud, you select your preferred data region. Once selected, your account and all its data will be hosted in that region.

For specific regional compliance requirements or questions, please contact us at compliance@langfuse.com.
