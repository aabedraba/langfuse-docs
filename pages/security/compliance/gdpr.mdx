# GDPR Compliance

Langfuse is committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area.

## Our Approach to GDPR

We have implemented comprehensive measures to ensure GDPR compliance:

- **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)**: We offer DPAs to our customers to formalize our commitment to GDPR compliance. Our DPA template is available [here](https://static.langfuse.com/legal/2025-02-17-Public-Langfuse%20DPA.docx.pdf).

- **Data Subject Rights**: We respect and facilitate the rights of data subjects, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object to processing.

- **Data Protection by Design**: Our systems and processes are designed with privacy in mind from the ground up.

- **Data Breach Notification**: We have procedures in place to detect, report, and investigate personal data breaches.

## EU Data Region

For customers who need to keep their data within the European Union, we offer an EU data region:
