# SOC2 Certification

Langfuse has achieved SOC 2 Type II certification, demonstrating our commitment to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

## What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is a framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for managing customer data. The certification verifies that an organization's information security measures meet today's cloud requirements.

## Our Certification
