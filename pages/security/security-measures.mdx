# Security Measures

At Langfuse, we implement comprehensive security measures to protect your data and ensure the reliability of our services.

## Langfuse Cloud

We maintain robust security measures for our cloud offering:

- **Encryption**: We encrypt all data at rest and in transit using TLS.
- **Infrastructure**: Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, partly managed by Clickhouse.
- **Backup and Recovery**: We use Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) with database backups and Write Ahead Log.
- **Authentication**: 
  - All users have access to SSO (Single Sign-On) through OAuth 2.0 with Google, GitHub, and Azure.
  - We can enforce SSO for your organization (Team plan and above) to require 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication).
  - We support configuration of custom SSO providers.
- **Data Confidentiality**: We do not use any of your data for model training and treat it confidentially ([terms and conditions](/terms)).

## Self-hosted Instances

For customers who choose to self-host Langfuse:

- **Installation and Configuration**: Detailed guidance is available in our [Self-hosting guide](/self-hosting).
- **Architecture**: For architecture and component diagrams, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Telemetry**: Information about basic telemetry is available in our [README.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/README.md#telemetry).
