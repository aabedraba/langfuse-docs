## About Khan Academy
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) serves 120 million learners annually across 190 countries in 56 languages. It provides free online courses, lessons, and practice exercises covering subjects from elementary math to college-level topics like calculus, physics, economics, and computer science. Khan Academy also provides tools for teachers and parents to track student progress. The mission: "Free online education for everyone, everywhere."

Khan Academy started their LLM journey in 2023 as an early access partner of OpenAI's GPT-4. They have learned many hard-won lessons and shipped dozens of cornerstone AI experiences led by their flagship AI product: [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/). 

## Challenge: Go-Based Infrastructure Meets AI
Running a nonprofit at this scale demands extreme resource efficiency. 

Khan Academy migrated to Go from Python starting in 2019, and when it came time to implement AI observability, they faced a unique challenge. Most tracing tools required specific SDKs or wrappers that didn't fit their Go-based architecture.

"What we really loved about Langfuse was the open API," says Walt from Khan Academy's engineering team. "While many tracing tools require specific SDKs or wrappers, Langfuse's open API enabled us to build our own Golang client around it. This was huge for our Go-based services."

## LLM Observability Across Product Teams

Since deploying Langfuse in April 2024 as one of our first enterprise customers, adoption has spread to over **100 users** across **7 product and 4 infrastructure teams**. The platform isn't supporting just one AI feature but dozens of AI interactions across different products.

The integration runs deep:
- **Internal UIs** link directly to Langfuse traces for user experience analysis
- **Community support teams** access traces for incident investigation
- **Engineers** share Langfuse URLs for collaborative debugging
- **Senior leadership** uses the platform for product decision analysis.

## Results: Speed Without Compromise

For Khan Academy, Langfuse solved multiple challenges simultaneously. The company avoided the engineering overhead of hosting their own tracing infrastructure for millions of learners while maintaining the flexibility to work within their Go ecosystem.
