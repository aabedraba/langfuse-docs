## About SumUp
SumUp is a leading global fintech company trusted by over 4 million merchants in more than 30+ markets worldwide. It stands out by making card payments easy and accessible for small businesses, offering simple, reliable hardware and software solutions. 

## The challenge
The mission was simple: empower SumUp’s merchant support teams with an AI assistant as the first entry point for all customer support touchpoints.
Yet the challenge was far from trivial. **Multi market complexity and scale:** SumUp's merchant support serves over 4 million merchants across 30+ markets with market specific differences in requirements. **Security & Privacy:** SumUp operates in Financial Services, data privacy and security are of paramount importance and had to be maintained throughout the project. **Systems Integration:** Conversations within SumUp’s customers are usually complex and require followups and clarifications as well as querying a variety of systems. The implementation had to model highly complex LLM interactions and tool uses.

## Solution: multiple layers of AI empowerment
**Merchant facing:** AI assistant that answers first line of questions & routes the conversation to humans if nessecary

**Internal:** Self-built AI translation tools allow support agents to help merchants in other languages than their own & an AI assistant that help agents finds most relevant resources and answers faster

## Rollout
SumUp handled their market rollout strategically and incrementally. Here is how SumUp rolled out AI-Powered Support to 30+ markets within 18 months successfully.

### Expansion Strategy  
- Begin with English-speaking markets (Ireland and UK)
- Focus on smaller volume merchants first  
- Slowly increase volume while monitoring reliability metrics  
- Expanded based on performance benchmarks  
- Prioritized markets with no existing support as "better than nothing"

### Rollout Timeline:  
- January 2024: Start of development & testing for Ireland / UK
- June-August 2024: Ramp up of Ireland / UK load 
- September 2024: 100% of Ireland / UK load and start of other markets
- July 2025 100% of all markets


## How SumUp is using Langfuse

In early PoC stages of the project **SumUp got started quickly with using Langfuse Self-Hosting** – no long vendor onboarding & evaluation before having a better understanding of project requirements and needs. Once the system got closer to production and full rollout, the team **happily switched over to let Langfuse Cloud** do the grunt work of making the systems run reliably.

Tracing was the clear starting point of implementation. Yet, during the project the team has set up elaborate multi-team workflows powered by Langfuse to enable continuous development & monitoring of 25 users across Engineering, Support Operations, Content, Q\&A and other stakeholders.

[Tracing: Deep Visibility Across Teams](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing) Langfuse gives SumUp a unified view on all LLM inputs, tool uses and outputs across functions. Engineers can run very detailed asynchronous debugging. Content owners understand shortcomings of LLM inputs & context documents. Q&A has full visibility in output quality

[Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started) & [Playground : Fast Iteration & Empowering Non-Technical Staff](https://langfuse.com/docs/playground)
Prompt management lets content teams and engineers alike iterate and test prompt changes in production really fast. The system is integrated with a self-built set of evaluators to test new iterations automatically. The Playground lets SumUp reproduce exact production configs, variables and tool integrations from production traces into a simple UI to quickly iterate on prompt improvements before implementing them. Reproducing the exact production environment was very time consuming for engineers and impossible for non-technical staff before using Langfuse.


## Business Impact
<CustomerQuote
  quote="Building on Langfuse we have achieved a 50% deflection rate of conversations that don't go to humans. That is 300,000 monthly merchant requests that no longer require human support – that’s 10,000 per day! Even though merchant numbers grow fast; we can focus our resources to the really tricky problems."
