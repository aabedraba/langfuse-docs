# Prompt Folders for Organization

Prompts can be organized into virtual folders to group prompts with similar purposes.
To create a folder, add slashes (`/`) to a prompt name. The UI shows every segment ending with a `/` as a folder automatically.

**Note**: accessing prompts in folders via the Python SDK requires `langfuse >= 3.0.2`.
