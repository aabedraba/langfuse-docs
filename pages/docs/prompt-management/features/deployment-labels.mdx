# Prompt Deployment Labels

Labels can be used to fetch specific prompt versions in the SDKs. When [using a prompt](#use-prompt) without specifying a label, Langfuse will serve the version with the `production` label. The `latest` label points to the most recently created version. You can create any additional labels, for example for different environments (`staging`, `production`), tenants (`tenant-1`, `tenant-2`), or experiments (`prod-a`, `prod-b`).

**How to assign a label to a prompt:**

You can assign labels when [creating a new prompt (version)](#create-update-prompt).

Alternatively, you can also update the labels of an existing prompt version:

```python
langfuse = Langfuse()
langfuse.update_prompt(
    name="movie-critic",
    version=1,
    new_labels=["john", "doe"], # assign these labels to the prompt version
)
```

</Tab>

You can assign labels when [creating a new prompt (version)](#create-update-prompt).

Alternatively, you can also update the labels of an existing prompt version:

```ts
langfuse = Langfuse();
await langfuse.updatePrompt({
  name: "movie-critic",
  version: 1,
  newLabels: ["john", "doe"],
});
```

</Tab>

### Protected prompt labels

  availability={{
    hobby: "not-available",
    core: "not-available",
    pro: "team-add-on",
    enterprise: "full",
    selfHosted: "ee",
  }}
/>

Protected prompt labels give project admins and owners ([RBAC docs](/docs/rbac)) the ability to prevent labels from being modified or deleted, ensuring better control over prompt deployment.

Once a label such as `production` is marked as protected:

- `viewer` and `member` roles cannot modify or delete the label from prompts, preventing changes to the `production` prompt version. This also blocks the deletion of the prompt.
- `admin` and `owner` roles can still modify or delete the label, effectively changing the `production` prompt version.

Admins and owners can update a label's protection status in the project settings.
