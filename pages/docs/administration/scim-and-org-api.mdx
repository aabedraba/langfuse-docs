Via organization-scoped API keys, you can administer projects, users, and project/organization memberships (see [RBAC docs](/docs/administration/rbac)).

Langfuse is open and meant to be extended via custom workflows and integrations.
You can use these endpoints to automate project and user management on your Langfuse organization.

## Authentication

Authenticate with the API using [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
Organization scoped API keys can be created via the [Organization Management API](/self-hosting/organization-management-api) or in the Organization Settings within the Langfuse UI.

Example:

```bash
curl -u public-key:secret-key https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/projects/{projectId}/apiKeys
```

## Organization Management

All applicable endpoints are marked with `(requires organization-scoped API key)`.
Those include the following routes:

- `POST /api/public/projects`
- `PUT /api/public/projects/{projectId}`
- `DELETE /api/public/projects/{projectId}`
- `GET /api/public/projects/{projectId}/apiKeys`
- `POST /api/public/projects/{projectId}/apiKeys`
- `DELETE /api/public/projects/{projectId}/apiKeys/{apiKeyId}`
- `PUT /api/public/organizations/memberships`
- `GET /api/public/organizations/memberships`
- `PUT /api/public/projects/{projectId}/memberships`
- `DELETE /api/public/projects/{projectId}/memberships`

## User Management via SCIM

In addition, we implement the following [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) compliant endpoints.
Use `/api/public/scim` as the base URI for them.

To create a new user within Langfuse, you can use the SCIM-style endpoints and `POST /Users`.
This will create a new user if the email does not exist yet.
Then it will add the user to the organization with role `NONE`.

Afterward, the role can be updated using the membership endpoints either on an organization or a project level (see above).

To remove a user from an organization, call the `DELETE /Users/{id}` endpoint.
This will not delete the user itself, only its membership with the organization.

You can either supply an initial password for users via the API and share it with them, or use Single Sign-On (SSO) to authenticate users.
In the latter case, you need to:

- Langfuse Cloud: configure an Enterprise SSO provider ([docs](/security/auth)).
- Self-hosted: configure `AUTH_<PROVIDER>_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING` for your SSO provider to ensure that the user accounts are linked correctly [SSO Docs](/self-hosting/authentication-and-sso#additional-configuration).

The following SCIM endpoints are available:

- `GET /ServiceProviderConfig`
- `GET /ResourceTypes`
- `GET /Schemas`
- `GET /Users`
- `POST /Users`
- `GET /Users/{id}`
- `DELETE /Users/{id}`
