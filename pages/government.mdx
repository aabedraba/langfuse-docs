# Build Trustworthy AI for Mission Success in Government

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), presents a transformative opportunity for government agencies. However, this powerful technology also introduces new challenges. Ensuring the reliability, transparency, and security of AI applications is paramount for maintaining public trust. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a draft of the AI RMF (Risk Management Framework) for AI systems, which provides a framework for managing the risks associated with AI systems. As one key pillar, the AI RMF recommends regular measurements to ensure a valid and reliable deployment of AI systems.

Langfuse enables mission owners to deploy reliable, traceable, and cost-efficient AI systems while meeting government security and compliance requirements.

As an open source project, Langfuse is the ideal platform to address data security and privacy concerns by self-hosting on FedRAMP authorized infrastructure.

Langfuse is licensed as an open-core project. It’s core product (tracing, observability, evals, prompt management and API/SDK endpoints) is MIT-licensed and freely available (also without limitation for commercial use). Some Langfuse features on the periphery of the core product are not available in the open-source version and cannot be used out of the box. As of today, these are security & compliance features (e.g. SSO enforcement, data retention)
