## Official support

There are three primary ways to get help from the Langfuse team:

1. **Open a request via the in‑app help** (Cloud Core and above)
2. **Ask the community in public:** Start a thread in **[GitHub Discussions](/gh-support)**.
3. **Report a bug:** File an issue in **[langfuse/langfuse Issues](/issues)** with a minimal reproduction and logs.

### In‑app support (by Langfuse Engineering)

- Available to **Cloud Core, Pro, Teams, and Enterprise** customers.
- Open the **help/chat** widget in the Langfuse UI to create a ticket. We’ll route it to the right team and reply via email.
- For non‑urgent questions, public **GitHub Discussions** remains the fastest way to get searchable answers.

<details>
<summary>Severity levels</summary>

When you contact us, please indicate one of the following severities to help us prioritize:

- **P0 – Critical:** Langfuse is unavailable or there is security risk or data loss. Examples: API/ingestion outage, authentication failure across users, confirmed security incident.
- **P1 – High:** Key functionality is severely degraded. Examples: traces not ingesting reliably, prompt management read/write failures, dashboards consistently failing to load, SDK regression with common paths.
- **P2 – Medium:** Partial impact or inconvenient issues. Examples: slow queries or UI, intermittent errors with workarounds, minor SDK bugs.
- **P3 – Low:** Questions, feature requests, cosmetic issues.

## Dedicated Slack

For qualifying customers, we provide support via Slack Connect. This brings all parties together on both sides and makes collaboration much faster for everyone involved.

You will directly chat with the engineers building Langfuse to find the best solutions to your questions.

Please reach out via In-app support to request a private Slack channel.

## Onboarding & Architectural guidance

We can help teams get value from Langfuse quickly:

- Onboarding workshops and Q\&A for new teams
- Best‑practice setup for tracing, evaluations, and prompt management
- Architectural reviews when integrating Langfuse into your existing platform

Available on Enterprise plans. Ask your account team.
