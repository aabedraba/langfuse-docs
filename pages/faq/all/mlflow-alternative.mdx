# The best LLMOps Tool? MLflow vs. Langfuse

MLflow and Langfuse are both open-source tools that support the operationalisation of Large Language Models (LLMs), but they focus on different stages of the LLM application lifecycle.

## How do MLflow and Langfuse compare?

## ðŸª¢ Langfuse in a nutshell

Langfuse is an open-source LLM observability platform. It traces every step of complex workflows (e.g. RAG pipelines, agents), tracks latency, token usage & costs, and lets teams iterate on prompts and evaluations **without redeploying**.

## MLflow in a nutshell

MLflow is a mature open-source MLOps platform maintained by Databricks. Since v2.4 it ships specialised **LLMOps** features:

- **Experiment & Model Tracking**: log prompts, parameters, responses.
- **Evaluation**: `mlflow.evaluate()` with ready-made metrics (hallucination, factuality, toxicity â€¦).
- **Prompt Engineering UI**: experiment with prompts & parameters side-by-side.
- **AI Gateway**: central governance & credential management for multiple LLM providers.

> MLflow is an excellent choice when you already use the Databricks ecosystem or need a registry & deployment workflow for many model types.

## When to choose which?

| Choose **Langfuse** when â€¦ | Choose **MLflow** when â€¦ |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| You need deep visibility into production LLM chains, RAG pipelines or agent graphs. | You need experiment tracking, registries and governed deployment pipelines. |
| You want to iterate on prompts & evaluations live, without redeploying. | You are heavily invested in the Databricks / MLflow stack already. |
| You prefer a lightweight, framework-agnostic SDK you can self-host. | You need central governance of API keys & rate limits across many SaaS LLMs. |

### Can I use both together?

Yes. Many teams use **MLflow** for model development & registry, then feed runtime traces into **Langfuse** for observability and evaluation once the model is in production.
