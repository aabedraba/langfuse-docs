# How does Langfuse encrypt my data?

Langfuse implements comprehensive encryption to protect your data both at rest and in transit.

## Encryption at Rest

All data stored in Langfuse is encrypted using **AES-256 encryption**, the industry standard for data protection:

- **Database Encryption**: All database records are encrypted before being written to disk
- **File Storage**: Any uploaded files or artifacts are encrypted using the same AES-256 standard
- **Backup Encryption**: Database backups are also encrypted to ensure data protection

## Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted to and from Langfuse is protected using **TLS 1.2+** encryption:

- **API Communications**: All API requests and responses are encrypted
- **Web Interface**: The Langfuse dashboard uses HTTPS with strong cipher suites
- **Database Connections**: Internal database connections use encrypted channels

## Key Management

- **Key Rotation**: Encryption keys are regularly rotated following security best practices
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)**: Keys are protected using industry-standard HSMs
- **Access Control**: Encryption keys are accessible only to authorized systems and personnel

## Regional Data Storage

For compliance with data residency requirements:
- **EU Data**: European customer data is encrypted and stored in EU data centers
- **US Data**: US customer data is encrypted and stored in US data centers
- **Custom Regions**: Enterprise customers can specify preferred data regions

## Self-Hosted Encryption

For self-hosted deployments:
- You maintain full control over encryption keys
- Support for customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
- Integration with your existing key management infrastructure
