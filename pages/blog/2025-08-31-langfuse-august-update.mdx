This month, we've shipped updates to improve tracing for complex agents, enhance team collaboration, and expanded the integration library. Here's what's new:

## New Observation Types

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
![observation types](/images/blog/2025-08-31-langfuse-august-update/observation-types.png)
</Frame>

We've introduced new observation types to give you deeper insight into your agent's behavior. You can now semantically label spans as **Agent, Tool, Chain, Retriever, Embedding, and Guardrail**, making it easier to debug and analyze complex traces.

For most agent framework integrations, these types are detected automatically. You can also set them manually via the Langfuse Tracing SDKs.

## End-to-End Walkthrough Videos

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

</Frame>

We've released many new capabilities over recent months. We recorded four new short videos covering observability, prompt management, and evaluation to help you get up to speed quickly. Go check them out!

## Agent Demo Project

Experiment with our revamped interactive demo (langfuse.com/demo) that uses the Langfuse Docs MCP server to help with Langfuse questions. This demo uses the new observation types mentioned above.
