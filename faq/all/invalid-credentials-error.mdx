# Unable to log in due to invalid credentials error

If you encounter an 'invalid credentials' error while attempting to log into your Langfuse account, here are the steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Your Email and Password**: Double-check that you've entered the correct email address and password. Ensure that there are no typos and that the caps lock key is off.

2. **Reset Your Password**: If you’re unsure of your password, use the 'Forgot Password?' link on the login page to reset it. Follow the instructions sent to your registered email address to create a new password.

3. **Check Account Status**: Ensure that your account has not been locked or disabled for any reason. Contact Langfuse support if you suspect this might be the case.

4. **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser’s cache and cookies, as they can sometimes cause login issues. Try logging in again after clearing them.

5. **Internet Connection**: Confirm that you have a stable internet connection. Network issues can affect your login ability.

6. **Contact Support**: If none of the above steps work, reach out to Langfuse support at support@langfuse.com for further assistance. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including any error messages you’ve received.
