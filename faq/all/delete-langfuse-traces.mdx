# How to delete traces in Langfuse?

Traces in Langfuse can be deleted by using either the user interface (UI) or by utilizing our software development kits (SDKs). Hereâ€™s how you can do it using both methods:

## Using the UI:
1. Log in to your Langfuse account and navigate to the dashboard.
2. From the dashboard, access the section where traces are displayed.
3. Select the trace(s) you wish to delete. Usually, you can select traces by clicking checkboxes next to each trace.
4. Once selected, look for a delete or trash icon/menu option, and follow the prompts to confirm the deletion.

## Using SDKs:
1. Ensure you have integrated the Langfuse SDK into your application.
2. Within your application logic, call the appropriate method provided by the SDK to delete traces.
3. Pass in the identifiers or criteria to specify which traces to delete.
4. Execute the command to complete the deletion process. Check your SDK documentation for specific code examples and options available for trace management.

By following these steps, you should be able to delete any unwanted traces from your Langfuse logs.
